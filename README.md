    Manage your team inside the Tavern
    Use gold to buy items from the shop
    Gold is gained only if you win the battle
    Press the "Start Battle" button to start a battle
    Characters gain experience points only if they survive the battle

Save Progress

The game uses local storage to save progress. If local storage is deleted, progress will be reset.

Battle System

The game is an autobattler, meaning that once the player starts a battle, the game plays itself until one side is victorious. Both characters and enemies use a random targeting system for the most part, but there is a weight system that influences who gets targeted by each enemy and the same applies for enemies.

Character Progression

Characters gain experience points by surviving battles. Once a character earns enough experience points, they can spend that EXP to level up and gain access to new abilities and stats.
